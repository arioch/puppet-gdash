##Overview

This module installs GDash and enables creation of dashboards using manifests.

##Module Description

GDash is a dashboard for Graphite, therefore it is assumed you have a Graphite installation GDash will be pulling data from. This module does **not** manage Graphite in any way.

##Setup

This module assumes that you will be serving GDash using a Rails server such as Passenger. It will:

* Install all required Ruby gems
* Clone the GDash Git repository
* Create a default dashboard configured to use your Graphite server
* Provide a framework for you to declare graphs and fields in your manifests

Add the following to your manifest to create an Apache virtual host to serve GDash using Passenger. **NOTE** This requires the puppetlabs-apache module.

```puppet
    # Enable Apache modules
    class { "apache::mod::headers": }
    class { "apache::mod::passenger":
        passenger_high_performance  => "On",
        passenger_pool_idle_time    => 600,
        passenger_max_requests      => 1000,
        passenger_root              => $apache::params::passenger_root,
        passenger_ruby              => $apache::params::passenger_ruby,
        passenger_max_pool_size     => 12,
    }

    # Create Apache virtual host
    apache::vhost { "gdash.example.com":
        servername      => "gdash.example.com",
        port            => "9292",
        docroot         => "/usr/local/gdash/public",
        error_log_file  => "gdash-error.log",
        access_log_file => "gdash-access.log",
        directories     => [
            {
                path            => "/usr/local/gdash/",
                options         => [ "None" ],
                allow           => "from All",
                allow_override  => [ "None" ],
                order           => "Allow,Deny",
            }
        ]
    }
```

###Beginning with GDash

To install GDash with the default parameters:

```puppet
    class { 'gdash': }
```

This assumes that you have Graphite running on the same server as GDash, and that you want to install GDash to /usr/local/gdash. To establish customized parameters:

```puppet
    class { 'gdash':
      graphite_host     => 'http://graphite.example.com',
      gdash_root        => '/opt/gdash',
    }
```

##Implementation

###Classes and Defined Types

####Defined Type: `gdash::category`

Creates a category for your dashboard(s) to be grouped into.

```puppet
    gdash::category { "gdash": }
```

####Defined Type: `gdash::dashboard`

Creates a dashboard for your graphs to be organized under.

```puppet
    gdash::dashboard { "gdash":
        name        => "GDash",
        description => "GDash Server",
        category    => "gdash",
        require     => Gdash::Category["gdash"],
    }
```

####Defined Type: `gdash::graph`

Creates a graph in a dashboard.

```puppet
    gdash::graph { "gdash_cpu_usage":
        name        => "GDash CPU Usage",
        vtitle      => "percent",
        area        => "none",
        ymin        => 0,
        ymax        => 100,
        description => "CPU Usage for the GDash server",
        dashboard   => "gdash",
        category    => "gdash",
        require     => Gdash::Dashboard["gdash"],
    }
```

####Defined Type: `gdash::field`

Adds a field to a graph.

```puppet
        gdash::field { "${hostname}_cpu_user":
        scale           => 1,
        graph           => "gdash_cpu_usage",
        color           => "yellow",
        legend_alias    => "$hostname User",
        data            => "sumSeries(servers.${hostname}.cpu.total.user)",
        category        => "gdash",
        require         => Gdash::Graph["gdash_cpu_usage"],
    }
```

###Templates

This module currently makes use of three templates: one containing the configuration for GDash's main dashboard; one used to create custom dashboard; and one to create graphs.

##Limitations

This module has been tested on CentOS 6.4 with Apache and Passenger. Other configurations should work with minimal effort, as only package names may change.
